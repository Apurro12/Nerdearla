# And here?

Here instead of using the built in function create_react_agent, we are going to compile the react agent by ourselves

There are three different implementations of the react_agent

1) 01_agent_simple_decoupled.py
2) 01_agent_simple.py
3) decoupled_yield.py

where each one varies the way the agent connect to the MCP server, it is worth to check the differences betwheen each one
